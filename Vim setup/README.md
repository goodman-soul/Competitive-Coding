### Vim Environment (Customised for me)

#### Install vim in Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install vim

.vimrc file is attached

#### install vundle for vim-> can be found online

-> open vimrc file and paste the following line

exit-> open vim > type "esc"+ ":PluginInstall "

will install all the required plugins

:term ->open the terminal window
<F8> for compiling c++ code
I use CP Companion to scrape the problems

:%y+ to copy all the code in vim...
